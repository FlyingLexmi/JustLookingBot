# JustLookingBot
<hr>
<p align="center">
The first version of JustLookingBot is designed to gather all the information about the most popular anarchy Minecraft servers, including 0b0t, 9b9t, 8b8t, and 2b2t.org.ru. If you've played on the 0b or 8b servers, you're likely familiar with the /tpa command. I used the /tpa command to deliver kits to players on the server. To request a kit, you simply need to enter a command in the chat (&kit "kit name").
